# Energy-Data-Migration-Project
A project demonstrating data migration for energy generation data 
This project demonstrates the migration of energy generation data from the `energy_generation` table to the `archived_generation` table in PostgreSQL. 

## Tables

- **`energy_generation`**: Contains raw data on energy generation, including columns for plant name, generation type, amount, and date.
- **`archived_generation`**: Stores migrated data for reporting, including plant name, generation type, total generated, and date.

## Conclusion
This project showcases a simple data migration process in PostgreSQL.
